    <p>
      Insertion sort is an algorithm which can be identified by its two nested loops. Insertion sorting algorithms represent 
      qaudratic sequences when sorting a collection of items and can be represented by O(*n*2*) in Big O Notation. The problem
      with qaudratic solutions is the relationship between nested loops and increasing time exponentially depending on the input
      size.

    <p>
      Insertion sorting works by looping through items and inherently finding the head 
      (smallest number of the sequence),
      and inserting that into the front of the sequence. From there, every number is copied and put one index ahead to
      make way for the next smaller number to be inserted into the sequence. This loops until the sequence has been ordered
      in sequence from smallest to largest.

        function insertionSort (items) {
            <br> (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { </br>
               let value = items[i] 
              <br>// store the current item value so it can be placed right<br>
              for (var j = i - 1; j > -1 && items[j] > value; j--) {
               <br> // loop through the items in the sorted array (the items from the current to the beginning)<br>
                // copy each item to the next one
                items[j + 1] = items[j]
              }
             <br> // the last item we've reached should now hold the value of the currently sorted item<br>
              items[j + 1] = value
            }
          
            return list
          }
          
          const list = [54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20]
          console.log(insertionSort(list)) // [ 17, 20, 26, 31, 44, 54, 55, 77, 93 ]
